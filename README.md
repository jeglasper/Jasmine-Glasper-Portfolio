# Jasmine-Glasper-Portfolio

## Description

### Project Motivation & Purpose

My motivation for completing this project is to create a one-stop shop for potential recruiters to find me work as well as know how to contact me. This page serves dual purposes: 1. A Website Portfolio; and 2. A Work-Product that shows off the skills I have learned during my time in the UTSA coding bootcamp. The problem this solves is having a real-world example of what I can create and to begin my work portfolio as a professional web developer.

### What I Learned Doing This Project

I learned how to manipulate flexbox and create containers within containers to have content shift to accommodate the sizing of the web browser and/or be mobile-friendly if accessed on a cell phone, tablet, or other tech device. Additionally, through this project, I learned how to utilize ChromeDevTools to see how the CSS is being applied and to simplify my code. Lastly, I actively practed how to comment out code without deleting it until I got to a final product that met the acceptance criteria for the project.
